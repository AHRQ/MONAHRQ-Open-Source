CMS-OVERALL-STAR,Overall,CMS,Overall Rating,CMS Hospital Compare Overall National Rating,"What is the overall rating?

The overall rating combines the results of 64 individual ratings including how well the hospital takes care of patients who have conditions such as heart attack, stroke, and pneumonia; how often patients die in the hospital while receiving care; patient experiences of care; and how safely the hospital provides care. The overall rating shows how well each hospital performed, on average, compared to other hospitals in the U.S. The overall rating ranges from one to five stars. More stars are better.

How can I use the overall rating?

The overall rating can provide a starting point for comparing hospitals in your area. Use the overall rating to help you select which hospitals you would like to learn more about. Then, use the individual ratings to help you choose the best hospital for you or your family.

Where does the overall rating come from?

Hospitals report data to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). To learn more about how the overall rating is calculated, visit the CMS website. 

Why is the overall rating not displayed for some hospitals?

For an overall rating to appear for a hospital, the hospital must have enough data on the individual ratings used to calculate the overall rating. Some hospitals may not report all of their data or may not have enough data to report, and as a result, an overall star rating cannot be calculated.'",,,N,,,,,,,,,,,,,"What is the overall rating?
